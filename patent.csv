PATENT TITLE,PATENT NUMBER,PATENT ABSTRACT
ANTIGEN BINDING PROTEIN AND ITS USE AS ADDRESSING PRODUCT FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER,US9173962B2,"The present invention relates to a novel antigen binding protein, in particular a monoclonal antibody, capable of binding specifically to the protein Axl as well as the amino and nucleic acid sequences coding for said protein. From one aspect, the invention relates to a novel antigen binding protein, or antigen binding fragments, capable of binding specifically to Axl and, by inducing internalization of Axl, being internalized into the cell. The invention also comprises the use of said antigen binding protein as an addressing product in conjugation with other anti-cancer compounds, such as toxins, radio-elements or drugs, and the use of same for the treatment of certain cancers."
"ANTI-DR5 FAMILY ANTIBODIES, BISPECIFIC OR MULTIVALENT ANTI-DR5 FAMILY ANTIBODIES AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF",US10647774B2,Anti-DR5 family member antibodies and bispecific antibodies comprising one or more anti-DR5 family member antibodies are disclosed. These antibodies can be used to trigger cell death on DR5 positive cells.
METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVING A SEARCH RANKING USING POPULATION INFORMATION,US8515951B2,"Systems and methods that improve search rankings for a search query by using data associated with queries related to the search query are described. In one aspect, a search query is received, a population associated with the search query is determined, an article (such as a webpage) associated with the search query is determined, and a ranking score for the article based at least in part on data associated with the population is determined. Algorithms and types of data associated with a population useful in carrying out such systems and methods are described."
EXTRACTING STRUCTURED KNOWLEDGE FROM UNSTRUCTURED TEXT,US20150356463A1,"Embodiments of the present invention relate to knowledge representation systems which include a knowledge base in which knowledge is represented in a structured, machine-readable format that encodes meaning. Techniques for extracting structured knowledge from unstructured text and for determining the reliability of such extracted knowledge are also described."
ENHANCED KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORY,US9519681B2,"Embodiments of the present invention relate to knowledge representation systems which include a knowledge base in which knowledge is represented in a structured, machine-readable format that encodes meaning."
PROTEIN CONSTRUCTS DESIGNED FOR TARGETING AND LYSIS OF CELLS,US9644033B2,"The invention relates to a protein construct, comprising (i) a targeting moiety that is capable of binding to a target cell, and (ii) an effector immunogenic moiety that is capable of triggering an existing, vaccine-induced or natural, immune response. The protein construct, that is preferably in the form of a heteromultimeric protein, is useful for redirecting an immune response that was pre-existing in a patient, toward an undesired target cell."
STIMULATION OF THE SYNTHESIS OF THE ACTIVITY OF AN ISOFORM OF LYSYL OXIDASE-LIKE LOXL FOR STIMULATING THE FORMATION OF ELASTIC FIBERS,US8906425B2,"The invention relates to the stimulation of the synthesis and of the activity of an isoform of lysyl oxidase, and more particularly of the LOXL (lysyl oxidase-like) isoform. The invention relates notably to a method of identifying an active principle which stimulates the formation of elastic fibers. The aim of the invention is mainly to provide such a method of identification so as to provide compositions which enable stimulating the formation of elastic fibers."
KNOWLEDGE REPOSITORY,US9098492B2,"A knowledge storage system is described. A specific embodiment is a computer system comprising a knowledge base of general knowledge in structured form which can be added to and queried by untrained users. Various embodiments include the facility for remote computers to access the knowledge stored in the system, natural language questions to be answered, profile screens giving general knowledge about an object in the system, and methods for distinguishing between reliable and unreliable facts."
"DEVICE, METHOD, AND GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE FOR ENABLING CONVERSATION PERSISTENCE ACROSS TWO OR MORE INSTANCES OF A DIGITAL ASSISTANT",US20190095171A1,"An electronic device with one or more processors and memory includes a procedure for enabling conversation persistence across two or more instances of a digital assistant. In some embodiments, the device displays a first dialogue in a first instance of a digital assistant user interface. In response to a request to display a user interface different from the digital assistant user interface, the device displays the user interface different from the digital assistant user interface. In response to a request to invoke the digital assistant, the device displays a second instance of the digital assistant user interface, including displaying a second dialogue in the second instance of the digital assistant user interface, where the first dialogue remains available for display in the second instance of the digital assistant user interface."
HPV PARTICLES AND USES THEREOF,US10688172B2,"The invention relates to modified HPV particles that can be used therapeutically. Modified HPV particles may be used to deliver therapeutic agents, including siRNA molecules. Modified HPV particles may be used for the treatment of diseases or conditions of mucosal tissue, including HPV (human papilloma virus) infection and HPV-related tumors."
